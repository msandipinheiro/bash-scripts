Controls how long a snapshot can take before timing out in milliseconds (1000 milliseconds = 1 second).  This applies to all camera types.  If your snapshot takes longer than this, it will be cancelled as best as possible.  Warning:  If you are using a gcode camera, and it takes longer than the timeout to execute, but it eventually DOES execute, Octolapse may mistake the response as belonging to another request.  This would be highly unusual to occur in practice, but in general you want to make sure any gcode cameras script does NOT time out.
