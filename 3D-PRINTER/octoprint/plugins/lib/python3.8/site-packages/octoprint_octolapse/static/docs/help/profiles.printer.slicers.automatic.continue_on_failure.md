There are many situations that can prevent Octolapse from creating a timelapse.  Most of these can be detected before your print starts (especially when using the 'smart layer trigger').  If Octolapse detects an error, by default it will report the problem and cancel the print, giving you time to correct the problem before your print starts.  It is HIGHLY recommended that you leave this setting enabled, but this was added at the request of several users.  I would recommend disabling Octolapse if you don't want the timelapse to run due to errors you cannot solve.

This is an experimental setting, and Octolapse may cancel the print anyway under certain situations.  If you encounter any of these, please submit an error report [here](https://github.com/FormerLurker/Octolapse/issues), and I'll try to fix it for the next release.
