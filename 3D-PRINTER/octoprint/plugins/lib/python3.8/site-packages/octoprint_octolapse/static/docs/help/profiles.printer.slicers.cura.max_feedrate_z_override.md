This is used to set the Z travel speed IF this setting is below the 'Travel Speed'.  For example, if your travel speed is 120MM/sec and your Maximum Z Speed is 30MM/Sec, then your Z axis would always travel at 30MM/sec.  This setting has no effect if the maximum Z speed is ABOVE the Travel Speed.  Set to 0 to always use the Travel Speed to move the Z axis.
