Octolapse has two methods for determining the rendered video's framerate:
  
  * Fixed Run Length - Octolapse will dynamically adjust your FPS to get a video of fixed length.  The final framerate may be adjusted If the FPS is too low or too high (configurable with the min and max framerate options).  Note that the 'Fixed Run Length' setting does NOT include any post or pre roll time.
  * Static FPS - Use a constant framerate for the entire video.
