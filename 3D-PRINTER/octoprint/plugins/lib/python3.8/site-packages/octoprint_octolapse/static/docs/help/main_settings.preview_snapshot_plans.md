Snapshot previews are available when using any of the smart triggers, including snap to print mode.  When these are enabled you can review all of the snapshots Octolapse will take before starting your print.

The snapshot preview contains lot of useful information, including:

* The total number of snapshots Octolapse will take.
* The initial, snapshot, and return position of your extruder.
* The total travel distance for all snapshots.
* An estimation of the amount of travel distance saved using the smart layer trigger vs the classic (real-time) layer trigger.

You can even animate the entire sequence, giving you a good sense of how your timelapse will turn out before sending any gcode to your printer.
