Controls the exposure method, which determines how long the sensor will gather light for each frame.  Auto Exposure adds time to the snapshot process and can introduce unwanted flickering.  If a 'Manual' or 'Disabled' setting is available here, I recommend you use that in order to get the best possible timelapse.

If you are using manual exposure, try to keep your lighting levels as consistent as possible.  For example, if the sun is shining into the room and a cloud moves by, your image may be too dark.  I recommend closing the blinds and keeping the lighting levels consistent throughout your print.

In general, you want your exposure to be as low as possible in order to reduce your camera delay, and to prevent blurring.  If your camera has a 'Gain' setting, you can try increasing that as much as possible while still getting a good image, while reducing the exposure.  Using brighter lights will also allow you to reduce your exposure, so good lighting is highly recommended.
