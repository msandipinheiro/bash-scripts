This setting is used to tell Octolapse how fast to travel to the snapshot position.  The faster the speed, the quicker snapshots will be taken.  However, setting the travel speed too high can cause skipping, and might introduce vibrations that reduce print quality.  In general you want this value as high as possible without affecting normal printing quality.
