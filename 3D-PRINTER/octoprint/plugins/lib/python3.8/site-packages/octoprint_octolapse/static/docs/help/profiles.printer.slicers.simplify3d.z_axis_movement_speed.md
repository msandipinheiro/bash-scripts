This setting is used to tell Octolapse how fast to lift and delift when traveling to and from the snapshot position.  The faster the speed, the quicker snapshots will be taken.  However, setting the z-lift speed too high can cause skipping, which might cause your print to fail, or cause the extruder to hit the printed part.  In general you want this value as high as possible without affecting normal printing quality.
