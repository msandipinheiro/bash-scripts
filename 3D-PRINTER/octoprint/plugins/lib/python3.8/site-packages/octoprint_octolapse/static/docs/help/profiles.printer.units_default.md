This should be set to Millimeters for most printers.  Octolapse does NOT work with imperial units (yet, it may at some point), and will stop the timelapse if any position altering commands are detected while in 'Inches' mode.  However, if your printer does default to inches (is this true for any printer out there?), it is still possible to make a timelapse by including the G21 command before any position altering commands.
