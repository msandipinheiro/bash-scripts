Higher values will give you longer exposures.  The higher the exposure value the longer the image will take to capture, but the image will be brighter.

If your camera has an 'Auto Exposure' setting, you will probably need to disable that before being able to adjust the absolute exposure.  It is highly recommended that you use manual exposure for the smoothest possible timelapse videos.  Automatic exposure will cause flickering.

You want your exposure to be as low as possible in order to reduce your camera delay, and to prevent blurring.  If your camera has a 'Gain' setting, you can try increasing that as much as possible while still getting a good image, while reducing the exposure.  Using brighter lights will also allow you to reduce your exposure, so good lighting is highly recommended.

In general, try to keep your lighting levels as consistent as possible.  For example, if the sun is shining into the room and a cloud moves by, your image may be too dark.  I recommend closing the blinds and keeping the lighting levels consistent throughout your print.
