If your overlay settings are all entered AND you have a valid font selected (see the 'Font' setting for details), you can preview your overlay here.  Typically this is updated automatically, or you can click on any error messages you see in the preview area to force a refresh.

If your webcam is working properly and correctly configured within Octolapse, an attempt will be made to acquire an actual snapshot from your webcam so that your overlay preview will have the correct resolution.  If not a default 640x480 snapshot is provided.  Note that External/Script cameras (Including DSLRs) generally will NOT provide a real overlay preview.
