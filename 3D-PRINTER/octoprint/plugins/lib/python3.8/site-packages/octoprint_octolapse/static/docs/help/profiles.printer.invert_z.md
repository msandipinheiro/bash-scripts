Inverts the Z axis so that the lowest coordinate value is at the top of the build volume.  Octolapse will not be able to properly detect layer changes or create the proper lift gcode for printers with inverted z axis unless this option is checked.

Caution:  If this setting is incorrect, Octolapse will 'lift' down, probably ramming into your part or your printer bed.  It is unusual for the Z axis to be inverted (but not unheard of), so don't check this box unless you are absolutely sure that your Z axis is inverted.
