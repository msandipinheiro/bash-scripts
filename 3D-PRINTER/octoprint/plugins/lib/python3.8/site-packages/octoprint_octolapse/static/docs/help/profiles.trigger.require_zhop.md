If this option is enabled, Octolapse will only take snapshots when your printer is lifted.  This can have a positive effect on print quality, but might cause snapshots on some layers to be missed if there is no lift on a given layer.  If lift after retraction is disabled in your slicer, enabling this option might prevent snapshots from being taken entirely.
