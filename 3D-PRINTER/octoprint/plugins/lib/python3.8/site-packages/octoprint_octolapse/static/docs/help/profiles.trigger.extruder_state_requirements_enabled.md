Here you can control when and how Octolapse triggers a snapshot based on the current state of your extruder.  This option is only available when using a real-time trigger.  

If your printer profile settings are correct, Octolapse can track the state of your extruder. For example, it knows if your printer is about to retract, is in the middle of a wipe, or is currently extruding. These restrictions can be used to improve quality, by preventing snapshots when your extruder is in a particular state, like partially retracted, or after a deretraction.  If you are TOO restrictive, Octolapse may not take any snapshots or may miss taking snapshots on some layers. If you are too permissive, your print quality will suffer.
