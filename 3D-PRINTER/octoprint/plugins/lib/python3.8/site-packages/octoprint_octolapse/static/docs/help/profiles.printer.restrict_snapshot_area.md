Octolapse can prevent snapshot from occurring while the printer is outside of a given boundary.  When enabled snapshot will not be allowed outside the provided coordinates.  This is useful for preventing snapshots while priming outside of the normal print area (like the Mk2 and Mk3's priming area at the front of the bed), or to prevent snapshots on the first/final layers if desired.  When disabled your print volume will be used.
