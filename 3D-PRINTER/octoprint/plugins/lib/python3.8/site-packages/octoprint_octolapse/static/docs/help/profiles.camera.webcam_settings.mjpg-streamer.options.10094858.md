Controls the camera's focus.  Some cameras have automatic focus, and this must usually be disabled in order for manual focus to work.  

It helps to put book or something else with printed text EXACTLY where your print will be in order to adjust your focus.  It is much easier to adjust the focus when there is sharp text at the focal point.

You may also want to use the 'Stabilize Extruder' (not available when using snap-to-print or if stabilization is disabled) function to move your printer into position before adjusting your focus.

Lastly, if your camera has a 'Zoom' option, it might be easier to adjust the focus while your camera is zoomed in.  Once you are done adjusting the focus, you can change the zoom back to the original value.  If your camera has optical zoom, this method might not work.
