If your camera requires a password for basic authentication you can provide it here.  WARNING:  Your password is stored in plain text within the settings.json file.  Additionally if you enable certain diagnostic logging (log settings save, log settings load), your password will appear within the log file!  Finally, if you are using a remote webcam without SSL your password will be sent in PLAIN TEXT over the network!  Please be careful with your passwords and NEVER reuse your webcam password anywhere else!  If you are not using authentication (no user name entered) please erase any password entered here and save over your existing profile.
