When Loop is enabled you will have the option to invert the loop.  When the loop is inverted, instead of starting over again at the beginning of the loop when the end is reached, the path reverses direction.  Note that the beginning and end coordinates are NOT repeated.

Take the following X Stabilization Path:
49, 50, 51

Here are the snapshot coordinates for 6 snapshots with Invert Loop disabled:
49, 50, 51, 49, 50, 51

Here are the coordinates with Invert Loop enabled:
49, 50, 51, 50, 49, 50
