When enabled Octolapse will assume that your firmware is set to use the same retraction/deretraction settings (except z-lift) as your Octolapse profile. It is always a good idea to include an M207 and or M208 in your start gcode if you are using firmware retract/deretract so that Octolapse knows what values to use when tracking position.
