The number of seconds, not including any pre or post roll, that the timelapse be after rendering.  A fixed run length is achieved by changing the number of frames per second.  If the calculated framerate necessary to create a video of this length is too high or too low (see the Minimum FPS and Maximum FPS settings), the framerate may be capped, and the length of the video may be longer or shorter than this value.
