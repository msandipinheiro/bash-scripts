You can either import individual profiles or entire settings.json files via text or by uploading a file.  Choose how to import (text or file) here.

Note that you can download all of your settings from OctoPrint Settings (wrench/spanner icon)->Octolapse->Export Settings.  You can download individual profiles by going to OctoPrint Settings (wrench/spanner icon)->Octolapse, clicking on one of the profile tabs, and clicking on the download icon (<span class="fa fa-download"></span>) next to the profile you wish to download.  Post them online, or share them with your frinds!  If you come up with a great profile, please share it with me, and you may see it in the next version of Octolapse!
